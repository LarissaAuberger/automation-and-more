# Process Requirements

The process that you are going to create is called the Standard HR Open New Position process. This process covers how to fill a job position by submitting, approving, and routing a job requisition to the Human Resources (HR) department to search for position candidates.

The `Standard HR Open New Position` process includes the following requirements:

- The hiring manager must either fill a new position or replace an employee who is departing from an existing position.
- The hiring manager must determine the position requirements and prepare a position request to be submitted to the HR department. The hiring manager provides the following information in the request:
  - Name of the hiring manager
  - Title of the position
  - Name of the department that requires the position
  - Whether the request is for a new or existing position
  - Whether the job is part-time, full-time, or contract
  - When the position starts
  - Where the position is located

- For an existing position, the hiring manager must provide the following additional information about the person who will be replaced:
  - Given name
  - Family name
  - The personâ€™s manager or supervisor
  - Comments regarding the person

- The hiring manager reviews and approves the position request before the hiring procedure continues:
  - If the request is to fill an existing position, the hiring manager sends the request directly to HR. When HR receives the request, they search for candidates.
  - If the request is to fill a new position, the hiring manager sends the request to the general manager (GM) for approval.

- When HR receives the position request, they process it. The tutorial does not provide an implementation of this processing.
- The GM must evaluate the new position request and either approve or reject it.
  - If the GM approves the request, it then goes to HR so that HR can find candidates.
  - If the GM rejects the request, the hiring manager is notified and the process ends.
  - If the GM does not handle the request by the due date, the GM is notified.
